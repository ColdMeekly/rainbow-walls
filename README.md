## FAQ
Q) How do I use this?
A) There's releases tab at the top of this repo, you can find the compiled exe there.

Q) Is this safe?
A) It was safe before I released it, now I wouldn't trust it without modifying heavily.

Q) Are you going to be improving it further?
A) Nope, I thought about how I could really optimize it, but I'm too lazy.

## Credits
?? - I extracted parts from a MemoryLibrary from a youtuber I used to watch - he's now gone.
DarthTon - I used his findpattern algorithm, and adapted it to work for externals. (still room for improvement)
UnknownCheats - Has structs laying all over the place which made this quite fast to make.
